# BlueMon

A monitor for Minecraft mod download numbers, still very early into development.

Planned features include CurseForge support, periodic updates, and download traffic counting.

Licensed under MIT.

## Usage

Please check out the source code for more information at this moment.
I will not update this section until the user-facing interface is stable.

```console
$ go build
$ bluemon
```

TODO: write a better readme.
